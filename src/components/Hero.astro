      Life of calyle:
    </h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Thomas Carlyle, born in 1795 in the Scottish village of Ecclefechan, was
      the eldest child of James and Margaret Carlyle. His father, a stonemason
      and farmer, instilled in him a strong work ethic, believing that "man was
      created to work, not to speculate." His mother, a devout woman, hoped he
      would become a minister. Carlyle's upbringing was marked by his father's
      strict religious beliefs and his mother's struggles with mental health.
      Despite these challenges, Carlyle maintained a deep respect for his
      parents, and their influence profoundly shaped his character and
      worldview.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thomas Carlyle's early education began at home, with his mother, despite her
      limited literacy, teaching him to read, while his father instructed him in
      arithmetic. He then attended local schools in Ecclefechan and Hoddam, where
      he displayed a remarkable aptitude for Latin. Recognizing his talent, Carlyle
      was placed under the tutelage of a minister who guided him through Latin with
      impressive speed.
      <br />
      <br />
      Subsequently, he enrolled at Annan Academy, where he furthered his education
      in Greek, Latin, and French, while mastering arithmetic. However, Carlyle's
      time at Annan was marred by severe bullying from his peers. He endured two
      years of torment before finally standing up for himself, a period he later
      recalled as one of the most miserable in his life.

    </h3>

    <p>
      Carlyle's literary career flourished with the publication of "Sartor
      Resartus" in 1833-34, a unique blend of philosophy, satire, and
      autobiography that initially met with mixed reception but later gained
      critical acclaim. His subsequent works, including "The French Revolution"
      (1837), "On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History" (1841), and
      "Past and Present" (1843), solidified his reputation as a leading
      intellectual figure of the Victorian era. These works, characterized by
      their distinctive style and profound social and political commentary,
      continue to be studied and debated by scholars and readers alike.
